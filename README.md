## Logging Hours
We refer to an instance of volunteering as an "Activity." To log your hours, you must be in the `Activities` tab and tap the `+` button at the top of the page or the `Log Hours` buttom at the bottom of the page. You will now be presented with a form to fill out.

### Filling out the form
To save a form as a draft, at minimum, you must add the event location and supervisor name. The information asked for includes the following:
* Start time (with date)
* Amount of time volunteering (hours and minutes)
* Location of activity 
* Duties performed
* Name of Supervisor
* Supervisor Signature *(optional)*

The `save` button at the bottom of the form will remain disabled until all the mandatory information is filled out. Once the save button is enabled, you can tap on it to save everything you have typed to your device. The "Logged Activities" list will update with the newly added activity.

### Viewing and Editing an Activity
You can view the information you have entered for each logged activity by tapping on the desired entry in the "Logged Activities" list. You can tap on the fields to edit the information and add signatures. __The information will no longer be editable after an entry has been verified by a supervisor__ by adding a signature. Any verified entries will be marked by a green check mark similar to the one below:

## FAQ
> Why is the signature not mandatory?

I wanted the user to have the ability to create draft entries, so after they complete their service, they can simply hand their phone to the supervisor, have them read the details, and sign it. Also, if the supervisor did not have time to sign it that day, you would have it ready the next time so they can easily sign it. 

Most colleges will never actually look at your entries and they only consider the total amount of hours count, but just in case that they ever do, you will have these ready.

> Should I also use a hard copy along with the app?

Yes. You should always expect the unexpected and be prepared. If something happens to your phone, you should just keep a backup just in case. As of 7/2/2023, I am working on a way to export all your entries as a PDF or a CSV, so you can print it out.

Edit: You are now able to view all your entries as a spreadsheet, and you can print out or export the spreadsheet within the quicklook.

> Can't anyone just lie about their hours?

TL;DR Just don't cheat. It's never a good idea.

It's not a flaw with my app because you could still lie about it on hard copy if you wanted to. This app was created to have ease of use with logging volunteering hours, and it was not created as a way to cheat the system.
